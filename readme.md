# Stranded Ronin

2d top down shooter adventure game. Enter the Gungeon meets 2d Zelda (with some Far Cry for flavor). Science fiction fantasy mashup.

## The Setup

On an isolated planet a legend was born. A hero who came from the sky to vanquish an ancient evil. Wielding sword and pistol they sealed away the adversary and promised to return in the time of greatest need.

You are an amoral Samus-like bounty hunter who crash lands on this remote world. It is up to you to accept the title of hero and save the world, or repair your spaceship and leave them to their fate.

In the meantime space pirates have taken over, building large encampments and hoarding technology. You'll have to fight them to recover what was taken from you.
